    <h2>Description :</h2>

    <p>This classic lasagna recipe is made with an easy meat sauce as the base. Layer the sauce with noodles and cheese, then bake until bubbly! This is great for feeding a big family and freezes well, too.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients :</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>2 teaspoons extra virgin olive oil</li>
          <li>1 pound ground beef chuck</li>
          <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        </ul>

    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
        <li><strong>Put pasta water on to boil :</strong> Put a large pot of salted water (1 tablespoon of salt for every 2 quarts of water) on the stovetop on high heat. It can take a while for a large pot of water to come to a boil (this will be your pasta water), so prepare the sauce in the next steps while the water is heating.</li>
        <li><strong>Brown the ground beef :</strong> In a large skillet heat 2 teaspoons of olive oil on medium-high heat. Add the ground beef and cook until it is lightly browned on all sides. Remove the beef with a slotted spoon to a bowl. Drain off all but a tablespoon of fat.</li>
    </ol>
