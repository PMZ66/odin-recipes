    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>This oven-roasted chicken can also be spatchcocked and barbecued. If you don't like it too hot, adjust the amount of chillies in the piri-piri marinade</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>1 chicken, about 2kg</li>
        <li>6 red chillies</li>
        <li>6 garlic cloves</li>
        <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>To make the marinade, tip the dried chillies and the vinegar into a pan and bring to the boil. Remove from the heat and leave the chillies to soak until the vinegar is cold. Put the red chillies, garlic, soaked dried chillies and vinegar in a food processor and blitz.</li>
        <li>Sit the chicken in a shallow dish and use a small knife to score all over with cuts 1cm deep. Make sure you do the legs and the underside. Tip the marinade over the chicken and massage into the cuts.</li>
        <lI>When youâ€™re ready to cook, heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4. Roast the chicken for 1 hr, then turn the heat up to 220C/200C fan/gas 7 and cook for a further 30-35 mins until a crust has formed on the outside of the chicken.</lI>
