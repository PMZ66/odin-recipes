<h2>Description :</h2>

<p>Here’s my recipe for homemade pizza dough. And this is the breakdown of ingredients you need.</p>

<p>There’s only 6, plus some water : </p>

<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>

    <li><strong>Yeast:</strong> Instant yeast makes the job quicker. You need 1 standard packet.</li>
    <li><strong>Water:</strong> Use warm water to cut down on rise time, about 105ºF – 115ºF. Anything over 130ºF is too hot.</li>
    <li><strong>Flour:</strong> Use unbleached all-purpose white flour in the pizza crust. Bleaching the flour strips away some of the protein, which will affect how much water the flour absorbs.</li>
</ul>
