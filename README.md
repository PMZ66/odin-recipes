My first HTML assignment
As I'm getting to the end of the HTML lessons, I will apply my knowledge to create an index page with various recipes
Without any CSS knowledge, it won't look very pretty but I will try my very best
Let's see if I can do a bit of brutalist web design !!! 

8 PM = I created my index and recipe page. I used various elements including img, anchor, h1 and p
Time to move forward and keep improving my two pages, it's nice to see all my efforts are paying off
Trying my best to commit as much as I can in order to get used to it. 
Back to it now !!!!!
